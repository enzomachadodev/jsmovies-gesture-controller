## 📜About

The JSMovies Project is a video streaming platform that can be controlled through hand gestures and eye blinks. The Web Worker was also used to solve the browser's performance problem. All this is done using pure JavaScript and the power of Machine Learning directly from the browser without the need for a backend.

The technologies and knowledge applied in this project resulted from the JSExpert Week, an event about JavaScript, taught by the developer [Erick Wendel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erickwendel/?originalSubdomain=br).
